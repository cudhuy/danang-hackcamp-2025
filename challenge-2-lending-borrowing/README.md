## Challenge details

A decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Polkadot Asset Hub that enables users to lend their assets and borrow against their collateral, leveraging Polkadot's cross-chain capabilities and security features.

## Functional Specifications

- Collateral System : Users can deposit tokens as collateral, withdraw them when not locked in a loan, and use this collateral to secure their borrowing needs.

- Lending System : Users can borrow tokens against their collateral up to a limit determined by the collateral factor, with the restriction of having only one active loan at a time.

- Repayment System: Users can repay their loans either partially or in full, with the loan status automatically updating to reflect the current repayment state.
